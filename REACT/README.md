# React Folder

This folder houses various components used in Web Applications that
are constructed with React.JS. The Components are given appropriate
names that are then used as filenames. 

## Current Contents + Documentation:

### TextInput

Attributes:

- type:

Giving TextInput a type attribute directly applies the given type
to the <input> element that lies within.

---

- format:

### SelectDateRange

 - usage:

 SelectDateRange creates two input boxes that allow date selection,
 and a button that can be used to register changes to the rest of the
 page when the user has finished changing the date boxes. An onClick
 function must be made in the parent component of the SelectDateRange
 to determine this behavior.
