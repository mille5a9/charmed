Collection of C++ code written independently by a
Computer Engineering student. Currently a 3rd-year
undergraduate at the University of Cincinnati.

Inspiration drawn by documentation provided by wikipedia.

## Current contents:

### ADT

The ADT folder contains files that store self-written
Abstract Data Types. Some of the ADTs were written for
my classes at the University of Cincinnati. The files in
this directory are copied into other projects in this
repository as needed.

The mille5a9lib project is a C# implementation of the
types in this folder. They were written during my time
studying for Microsoft's Exam 70-483 for certification
in C#.

### BYTEPAIR

Implementation of the Byte-Pair Encoding concept. Takes an
input text file of bytes that are separated by newlines,
and compresses the bytes using byte-pair encoding.
Displays the new compressed number of bytes and the
compression ratio.

### MAZE

New attempt of Lab 3 from a Data Structures course. Lab 3
presented the task to solve a maze using stacks. Now
with knowledge of graphs, a shortest path function
with breadthfirstsearch methodology proves very useful
to better solve mazes.

### MD5

MD5 historic cryptographic hashing algorithm. A very old
algorithm used to turn strings of undefined length into
a 128-bit number. Project has been sidelined in favor of
other activities. May be continued at a later date.

### REACT

A collection of JSX files containing React.js components.

## Planned additions:

In the future, other projects of interest may be added.
