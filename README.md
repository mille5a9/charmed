Collection of cryptography-related code written independently by a Computer Engineering student.

Inspiration drawn by the contents of the Crypto++ library available online at www.cryptopp.com as well as documentation provided by wikipedia.



## Current contents (incompleted):

MD5 historic cryptographic hashing algorithm

Implementation of Byte-Pair Encoding concept. Takes an
input text file of bytes that are separated by newlines,
and compresses the bytes using byte-pair encoding.
Displays the new compressed number of bytes and the
compression ratio.


## Current contents (completed):

## Planned additions:

SHA-2

RSA & DSA Public-key Encryption

Blake2b Hash Function

IDEA & RC5 Block Ciphers

Something about lossless data compression
