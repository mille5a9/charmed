Collection of C++ code written independently by a Computer Engineering student.

Inspiration drawn by documentation provided by wikipedia.

## Current contents:

### ADT

The ADT folder contains files that store self-written
Abstract Data Types. Some of the ADTs were written for
my classes at the University of Cincinnati. The files in
this directory are copied into other projects in this
repository as needed.

### MD5

MD5 historic cryptographic hashing algorithm. A very old
algorithm used to turn strings of undefined length into
a 128-bit number. Project has been sidelined in favor of
other activities. May be continued at a later date.

### BYTEPAIR

Implementation of Byte-Pair Encoding concept. Takes an
input text file of bytes that are separated by newlines,
and compresses the bytes using byte-pair encoding.
Displays the new compressed number of bytes and the
compression ratio.

### NUM

First exploration of a sort of base-level machine 
learning. NUM is a script in Python (not my strongest
language) that uses an input file to teach itself
how to spell numbers. Also included is an attempt using C++.

## Planned additions:

In the future, other projects of interest may be added.
