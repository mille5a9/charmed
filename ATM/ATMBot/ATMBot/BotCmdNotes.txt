Note: "dto" stands for Data Transfer Object, it is used to interface the actual objects with the databases, which may have slightly different fields
and require precisely named public properties to be casted to with the Dapper library.

Commands (StringPrefix is "@ATM " for now, and team names use no abbreviations and underscores for spaces e.g. "University_of_Cincinnati_Bearcats_Men's_Basketball" or "Toronto_Maple_Leafs")

	helpme (e.g. "@ATM helpme")

	close (passcode) (passcode is a visible string in the source, so developers should know how to safely turn off the bot, but he auto-backups anyway)

	users (e.g. "@ATM users-ls")
		-ls (optional string name arg)
		-addme (optional string name arg, only for admins to add non-self users)
		-removeme (optional string name arg, only for admins to remove non-self users)

	teams (e.g. "@ATM teams-add")
		-add (name)
		-remove (name)

	remind
		-remind-new (prompts for additional inputs, tries to parse a date, remembers a message to pass to you later)
