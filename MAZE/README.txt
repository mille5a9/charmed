Herein lies a quick program I wrote to solve an ASCII maze.
Currently the code is designed to work with a maze of 1s and 2s,
with 1s being passable spaces. The program utilizes the shortestPath
function in the Graph ADT (and Linked Lists by extension). The code
currently only works with a maze of a size of 20 but I believe could
be improved to take any size of maze so long as it is a square.
