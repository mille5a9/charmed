# ADT Folder

This folder houses the abstract data types that I have created in my
Engineering Data Structures class. The data types have been put in
a namespace that is named after my student email @mail.uc.edu so as
not to conflict with any other similarly named structures. Any base
classes that were constructed in the course have not been included.

The filename structure is designed to associate similar types when
sorted alphabetically, so all of the files begin with the name of
the data type and then the subsequent identifiers that make it
unique (ex. treebinarysearch.h). The actual ADTs in the files
follow a naming structure of full Capitalization and proper word
ordering (ex. BinarySearchTree or ArrayList).

Currently included:  
stackarray.h  
stacklinked.h  
queuearray.h  
queuelinked.h  
queuepriority.h  
listarray.h  
listlinked.h  
treebinarysearch.h  
treeavl.h  
heapmin.h  
graph.h  
hashtable.h
