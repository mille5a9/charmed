# ADT Folder

## C++ Summer 2018

This folder houses the abstract data types that I have created in my
Engineering Data Structures class. The data types have been put in
a namespace that is named after my student email @mail.uc.edu so as
not to conflict with any other similarly named structures. Any base
classes that were constructed in the course have not been included.

Currently included:  
stackarray.h  
stacklinked.h  
queuearray.h  
queuelinked.h  
queuepriority.h  
listarray.h  
listsinglelinked.h
listdoublelinked.h
treebinarysearch.h  
treeavl.h  
heapmin.h  
graph.h  
hashtable.h  

## mille5a9lib

This folder houses the .NET Library Project I created while studying
for Microsoft\'s \"Programming in C#\" Exam 70-483. It contains all
the same data structures that were designed in my C++ based class
from Summer 2018, but with additional considerations brought about
by my newfound knowledge and understanding of best coding practices.
